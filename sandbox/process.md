1. Simulate Dirac and map it to Schrödinger
a. simulate energy levels of hydrogen atom for Dirac energy equation
b. map energy levels of hydrogen atoms with their corresponding atomic number etc

c. map those results to schrodinger results and see the difference 


2. Schrodinger equation - wavefunction - DONE

ℓ
Shape (s, p, d, f...)	Angular momentum

Magnetic	
𝑚
Orientation	Projection on z-axis


3. Dirac equation
